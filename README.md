# Search-engine-using-trie
A simple search engine which does pattern matching queries on text files using the data structure trie.  
The program also helps us to understand the time complexity of using trie rather than doing linear search. KMP-Algorithm is also used in the program for pattern matching. Also has a feature to visualize trie data structure.
